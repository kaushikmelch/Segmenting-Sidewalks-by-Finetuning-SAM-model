# Fine-tuning Meta's Segment Anything Model(SAM) to segment sidewalks using Satellite Imagery - cs6613-project

This project aims to fine tune Meta's SAM Model using a custom dataset containing satellite imagery. Further more the model is visually prompted to detect any occlusions such as trees to accurately detect sidewalks and predict potential sidewalks below such occlusions.

### Milestone 2
Run SAM_M2.ipynb for the results for milestone 2. 


### Milestone 3
Run SAM_Finetuning.ipynb in the Milestone3 directory to get the results.


### Milestone 4
The demo video can be found in the Milestone4 directory.

### Milestone 5

This file contains the fine tuned SAM model that detects sidewalks on satellite imagery. Further more the model is hosted on hugging face as well as an application.
